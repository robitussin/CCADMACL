Goal is to identify strong relations discovered in datasets using some measures such as confidence or lift.\n\nAn association rule is an implication expression of the form X→Y, where X and Y are seperate itemsets. A more concrete example based on consumer behaviour would be {Diapers}→{Beer} suggesting that people who buy diapers are also likely to buy beer. To evaluate the \"interest\" of such an association rule, different metrics have been developed. The current implementation make use of the confidence and lift metrics as which we just mentioned above","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- ***If a customer buys bread, he’s 70% likely of buying milk***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the above association rule, bread is the antecedent and milk is the consequent. Simply put, it can be understood as a retail store’s association rule to target their customers better. If the above rule is a result of a thorough analysis of some data sets, it can be used to not only improve customer service but also improve the company’s revenue.\n\nAdditional to above the association rule based learning techniques are also used in many applications such as recommendation systems, medical diagnosis, protein sequence, census data or even crime prevention, [click here for details ](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/most-common-examples-of-data-mining/)\n\nThe Apriori algorithm is one of the main technique of association rule mining, which can be basically descibed as finding the most frequent itemsets in a dataset.
